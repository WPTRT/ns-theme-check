# Contributing patches and new features

## Branches

Ongoing development will be done in the `development` branch with merges done into `master` once considered stable.

To contribute an improvement to this project, fork the repo and open a pull request to the `development` branch. Alternatively, if you have push access to this repo, create a feature branch prefixed by `feature/` and then open an intra-repo PR from that branch to `development`.

Once a commit is made to `development`, a PR should be opened from `development` into `master` and named "Next release - X.X.X". This PR will provide collaborators with a forum to discuss the upcoming stable release.

## Code Standards for this project

The code must follow the standards defined in the `phpcs.xml.dist` file in the root folder of the repo. Every pull request will go through the automatic check done by TravisCI.
